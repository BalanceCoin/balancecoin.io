      "BalanceCoin, known as BLC, is an energy-efficient, easy-to-use, fair, and decentralized encrypted digital currency based on a new consensus. It is also the world's first bitcoin fork that is based on the PoC (Proof Of Capacity) consensus mechanism.",
    desc2:
      'The name BalanceCoin was created to illustrate that the POC consensus is a combination of the advantages of POW and POS - it retains the elements of mining, ensures safety and fairness, and doesn’t consume large amounts of resources. We also firmly believe that the universe needs to achieve balance in order for all things to grow and prosper, just like our hope to build the BLC ecosystem.',

      desc:
        'Using the PoC Consensus, BLC no longer needs to consume an enormous amount of expensive electricity, because computing power is redefined as capacity rather than computing speed.'

      'Two to three years after the birth of Bitcoin, people gradually recognized its inherent value. With the gradual increase in the value of Bitcoin, proprietary ASIC mining machines have emerged, and ordinary, non-professional users can no longer join the mining oligopolies. At this point, the blockchain community urgently needs a new consensus mechanism to replace the energy-wasting algorithm of PoW and return Bitcoin to the people.'

      'Genes determine fate. After BLC went online, its inherently geeky nature and welcoming atmosphere spontaneously attracted countless miners to join the network. It also attracts many like-minded activists to join the revolution. They come from all over the world: China, Malaysia, Canada, Singapore, etc., with different industry backgrounds: software development, macroeconomics, investment banking, marketing, public welfare, and more. Some of them are serial entrepreneurs and corporate professionals born in the 70’s and 80’s, and some are college students born in the 90’s. Even if their cultures, professions, and stages of life are different, they are deeply fascinated by digital currency and blockchain, while adhering to the same belief: the dedication to a fair system brought about by the complete decentralization.',
